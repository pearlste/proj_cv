Met with Phil

Phil's plans:

    * Set up workspace
    * Get familiar with it, try some runs, etc
    * Review literature
    * Maybe look into possibility of eliminating need to specify -N and -S in run_caffe.py
    * Eventually may develop a script to automatically submit a sequence of jobs that only differ by the seed number, throttled by the load average. Maybe use batch?
    * Do an investigation, maybe one of:
        Convergence time PDFs, as a function of network parameters
        JPEG quantization scale factor impact on accuracy and convergence time
        How well does synthetic data translate into real data?
        Synthetic images for vehicles
